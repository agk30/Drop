## Installation

Installation is simple, just run the setup executable from the latest release.

[üîΩ Download Latest Release](https://github.com/motorlatitude/Drop/releases)

Once installed, drop will sit in your taskbar and wait for you to need it. It defaults to starting on system launch
so it will always be ready to use.

## Building

If you require your own custom built version of Drop, follow the below instructions and they should lead you to successfully
building Drop from source.

1.  Clone this repository, you can choose which branch to clone, master will contain the most stable version of Drop.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/motorlatitude/Drop.git && cd Drop
```

2.  Install RobotJS and target the electron version as defined in the package.json and make sure to have relevant build
    tools installed on your system as this is a native library.

```bash
npm install robotjs --target=7.1.12
```

3.  Install remaining dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

4.  Building Drop

    - #### Building to run on your system

      If you wish to use your built version as if using the installer run:

      ```bash
      npm run build
      ```

      Once completed, a setup executable should be in the ./dist/ directory, run the installer to use the built version.

    - #### Build for development purposes

      If you are using the code to make your own changes/modify it, it is easier to not run the npm build command
      until you have finished development work. Use the start command to test your modified version

      ```bash
      npm start
      ```
